# Offutt Playable Zombie Game

A simple first-person Unity game prototype featuring player movement, ballistic mechanics, zombie enemies, and a functional HUD.  
Developed as part of game design coursework to demonstrate fundamentals of Unity development, C# scripting, and game logic design.

## Overview

This project was built in Unity using C# scripts to implement:
- Player movement and physics with `Rigidbody` and `Collider` components  
- Basic enemy (zombie) AI for chasing and collision detection  
- Health and ammo display through a functional HUD  
- Simple environment design and lighting setup  
- Ballistics mechanics/physics

The game demonstrates foundational Unity mechanics including prefabs, materials, and physics-based interaction.
